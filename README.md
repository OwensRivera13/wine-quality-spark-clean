This project implements distributed model training using Apache Spark running on an AWS EC2 cluster, 
and a prediction application packaged and deployed through Docker. 
The model predicts wine quality based on chemical property inputs using the UCI Wine Quality dataset.

(NOTED: SSH keys have been removed for security reasons, code should run as normal without)
